# YorkURec Revamped
Elevating the YorkURec app experience through reverse engineering. Our goal is to provide a faster, more intuitive interface enriched with dynamic island support.

### Original App:
- **Challenges**:
  - Experienced significant latency, possibly due to hardcoded delays.
  - Dated interface and functionality.
  - User experience was less than optimal.

### Revamped App:
- **Enhancements**:
  - Rapid development cycle, realized in mere hours.
  - Modernized design and features.
  - Seamlessly add events to your calendar.
  - Optimized for quick launches, despite the exploratory nature of the code.
